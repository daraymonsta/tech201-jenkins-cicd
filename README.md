# tech201-jenkins-cicd

## Change to see if Jenkins-Github webhook works okay
## Change to dev branch 1 - expecting jenkins job to trigger - it did not

- modified branch in ramon-ci-job1 to dev branch

## 2nd change to dev branch

- Jenkins job triggered this time

## 3rd change to dev branch - use to test Job 2 (standalone first)

- Didn't work straight away
- Needed to checkout dev branch, then go back to main branch before merging

## 4th change to dev branch - check Job 1 and 2 trigger after each other

## 5th change on dev branch - re-started EC2 instance
